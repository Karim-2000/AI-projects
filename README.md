In this project, our team investigated search algorithms to determine the optimal travel route from Madrid to Barcelona using a dataset of Spanish cities. We implemented three search strategies—Breadth-First Search (BFS), Greedy Best-First Search, and A* Search with two heuristics (Haversine distance and a custom Euclidean heuristic)—and evaluated their performance. We constructed a graph connecting each city to its 10 nearest neighbors based on Haversine distance, then analyzed the algorithms’ efficiency in terms of execution time and path length. The results showed that A* Search (with both Haversine and Euclidean heuristics) found the shortest path at 747.66 km in 0.001 seconds, while BFS found a slightly longer path (760.56 km), and Greedy BFS performed the worst (905.96 km). We also examined the heuristics’ effectiveness, confirming that Haversine is admissible and consistent, while our custom Euclidean heuristic performed similarly in this case.
